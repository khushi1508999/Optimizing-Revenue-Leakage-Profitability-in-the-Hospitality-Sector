# Optimizing-Revenue-Leakage-Profitability-in-the-Hospitality-Sector
Data-driven project focused on identifying and mitigating revenue leakage in the hospitality sector. Developed analytical frameworks and strategic recommendations for pricing, service optimization, and profitability enhancement.
## Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying and addressing revenue leakage and optimizing profitability within the hospitality sector. Utilizing data analysis, I developed a framework to provide data-backed product and pricing strategies, justified with business logic and forecasting models. This project simulates the core responsibilities of a data analyst or consultant in the hospitality industry.

## Problem Statement
The hospitality industry often faces unexplained revenue leakages, fluctuating profitability, and underutilized service offerings due to factors like inefficient pricing, underperforming service segments, or misaligned customer targeting[cite: 25, 26]. Many mid-sized hotel chains lack a systematic approach to extract actionable insights from their data[cite: 27].

## Project Objective
To develop a framework that helps hospitality businesses identify root causes of revenue leakage, propose data-backed product and pricing strategies, and justify them with business logic and forecasting models (like Week-on-Week (WoW) and critical business KPIs like Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy %, and ADR)[cite: 28].

## Key Components & Deliverables
* **Data Analysis Module:** Explored booking trends (weekday vs. weekend, room types), seasonal occupancy vs. revenue correlation, ancillary service usage (spa, meals, transport), and customer segmentation based on spending behavior[cite: 28].
* **Root Cause Analysis:** Identified reasons for underperforming rooms/services, analyzed cancellation reasons and last-minute discount patterns, and assessed competitor pricing models and customer reviews[cite: 28].
* **Consulting Recommendations:** Proposed new pricing and bundling strategies (e.g., couple packages, weekend getaways, corporate stays), product optimization (e.g., repurposing underperforming services like event-hosting spaces into co-working spaces during off-season to boost profits)[cite: 29, 30, 31], and operational tweaks[cite: 29].
* **Business Justification:** Provided ROI and payback time for proposed changes, and scenario analysis (best case, worst case, most likely)[cite: 29].
* **Deliverables:**
    * Dashboard with KPIs (Average Revenue Per Available Room - RevPAR, Occupancy %, Service Revenue Split, etc.) [cite: 29] (Link to mock-up/image if applicable)
    * Recommendation Report (Link to PDF)
    * (Optional: Link to interactive prototype if created in Power BI/Tableau)

## Technologies Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Google Colaboratory
* (Add any other tools like Power BI, Tableau, SQL if used)

## Key Insights & Learnings
* [Summarize 2-3 most impactful findings, e.g., "Identified that event-hosting spaces were significantly underbooked during off-peak seasons, leading to revenue loss."]
* [Summarize 2-3 key recommendations, e.g., "Proposed a strategic pivot to convert underutilized event spaces into co-working hubs during weekdays, projecting a 15% increase in off-season revenue."]
* Learned to translate raw data into actionable business strategies and justify them with financial metrics.
* Gained experience in structuring a consulting-style project from problem identification to solution delivery.

## How to View/Run the Project
